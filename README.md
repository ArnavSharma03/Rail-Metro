# Rail Metro Using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm and Ant Colony Optimization

## Introduction

This java code implements a real-time use case of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a source metro station to every destination station in Dehradun. In this project, we consider each station as an string value starting from 0. When the user enters the source station, Dijkstra's algorithm is applied to calculate and display the least number of stations from the source to every other station.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(E logV) where E are the number of edges and V is the number of vertices in the graph.
- **Space Complexity:** O(V)

## Usage
Emergency Services: Improved routing efficiency can be crucial for emergency response teams, allowing them to arrive at accident or catastrophe sites sooner and more effectively, potentially saving lives.

Tourism and Navigation: Tourism and navigation apps can use efficient routing algorithms to give tourists and travellers with the best routes to their destinations, thereby encouraging tourism and improving user experience.

Trip Planner: A trip planner can be used to optimize public transportation routes in urban areas. By providing efficient routes and schedules for buses, trams, and trains, it can encourage more people to use public transport, reduce traffic congestion, and minimize the environmental impact of commuting.

Rural and Remote Areas: Rural and isolated locations deal with particular transportation issues; this project can improve accessibility and connectivity for these places, potentially increasing their economic development and quality of life.
